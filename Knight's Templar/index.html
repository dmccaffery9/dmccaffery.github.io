	<h2>What is the Knight's Templar?</h2>
    	<p>The Templars were skilled soldiers that fought for the Roman Catholic Church, and they're recognized by the red cross on their armor.</p>
    <h3>The Rise of the Knight's Templar</h3>
    	<p>After the First Crusade {The First Crusade was the first of a number of crusades that attempted to capture the Holy Lands, called by Pope Urban II in 1095.} stole Jerusalem in 1099 2 veterans from the crusade, French knight Hugues de Payens and his relative Godfrey de Saint-Omern thought that there should be some way to protect their people {the people of Jerusalem}. So, they brought their idea to King Baldwin II of Jerusalem, and in turn he gave them the Temple Mount, and that's how they got the name "Templar". The order began with 9 warriors and very few financial resources. They had a powerful advocate in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and it was through him that they became popular in the Christian faith and was endorsed by the church in 1129. They were heavily armed knight on war horses that would charge before anyone to break the lines and one of their most famous victories came in 1177 in the Battle of Montgisard,where some 500 Templar Knights helped to defeat Saladin's army of more than 26,000 strong.</p>
    <h3>The Fall of The Templar</h3>
        <p>. Muslims become more united under effective leaders such as Saladin and the odds were turning against them. The Templar Knights had to fight for the Holy Land and two other military organizations that were being supported by the church and that was a another chip on the Order's shoulder. Slowly and surely the Knights became less important as Crusaders were able to take back Jerusalem but only for a short while as it was captured and then the Knights were pushed north. They eventually ended up on the island of Cyprus and then were finally destroyed in the 1300s by the Mongols and the Egyptians.</p>
